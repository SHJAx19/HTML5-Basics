# HTML-for-beginners
HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a fundamental building block of the World Wide Web. It is a markup language that allows developers to create structured documents by defining elements and attributes to describe the content and layout of a web page.

HTML documents are made up of elements, which are enclosed by tags, and can contain attributes to provide additional information about the element. Elements can be used to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and other types of content.

HTML is used in combination with CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive web pages. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages.

Understanding the basics of HTML is essential for anyone who wants to create web pages or develop web applications. With HTML, developers can create content that is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, and can reach a global audience.
